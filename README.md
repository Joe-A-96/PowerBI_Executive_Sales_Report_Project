# PowerBI_Executive_Sales_Report_Project

## 💼 Executive Sales & Financial Performance Dashboard (Power BI)

**A high-level, interactive Business Intelligence dashboard designed for executive leadership, providing a comprehensive overview of sales performance, profitability, and key financial drivers for strategic decision-making.**

## 💡 Project Goal

The core objective of this project was to provide a consolidated, "single-pane-of-glass" view of the organization's sales health. The dashboard enables executives to quickly answer critical business questions and focuses on:

1.  **KPI Monitoring:** Tracking the performance of top-line metrics (**Revenue**, **Profit**, **Gross Margin**) against targets.
2.  **Strategic Analysis:** Identifying high-growth areas (products/regions) and underlying profit challenges.
3.  **Time Intelligence:** Providing **Year-over-Year (YoY)** and **Month-over-Month (MoM)** comparisons for trend assessment.

## 🛠️ Key Power BI Skills Demonstrated

This project showcases expertise in building sophisticated, enterprise-level BI solutions, emphasizing data governance and executive-friendly reporting.

### 1. Data Transformation (Power Query / M-Language)

* **Enterprise ETL:** Connected to and cleaned large, disparate data sources, ensuring data quality and consistency for executive reporting.
* **M-Language Proficiency:** Developed custom functions and complex transformations (e.g., handling ragged hierarchies, unpivoting data) within the Power Query Editor.
* **Date Table Automation:** Created a robust and dynamic **Date Dimension Table** essential for accurate time intelligence calculations.

### 3. Executive Dashboard Design & Visualization

* **KPI Visualization:** Used **Card Visuals** and **Gauge Charts** with conditional formatting to immediately highlight performance status against targets.
* **Guided Analysis:** Implemented **Drill-Through** and **Report Tooltips** to allow executives to seamlessly move from high-level summaries to transactional detail.
* **Visual Strategy:** Employed clear, consistent color palettes and a professional, uncluttered layout designed for maximum impact and minimal cognitive load.
* **Interactivity:** Integrated sophisticated **Slicers** and **Sync Slicers** to allow quick filtering by date range, region, and executive hierarchy level.
